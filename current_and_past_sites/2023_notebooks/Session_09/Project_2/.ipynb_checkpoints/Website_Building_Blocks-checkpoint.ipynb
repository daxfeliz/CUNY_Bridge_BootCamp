    "Every webpage on the internet is built using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). Every webpage is built up from elements, or single semantic componenets, which are represented in code as ```<element>```, which is called an element tag. For example, a blog you’d read online is built from a few paragraphs (```<p>```), a few images (```<img src=\"URL\">```), and links (```<a href=\"URL\">```) to other sites. Some elements, like images and links, exist as a discrete unit; however, other elements, like paragraphs, wrap other content. These elements that wrap content are represented in code as ```<element> Content </element>``` where that second element tag closes (represented with the ```</```) the first element tag. Because HTML is so dynamic, most of the elements encountered in HTML have wrapping capabilities and will require a closing tag. Comments in HTML are indicated with the opening and closing tags \n",
