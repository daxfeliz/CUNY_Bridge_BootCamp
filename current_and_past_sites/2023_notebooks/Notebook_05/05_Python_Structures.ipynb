So, we can look at the standard programming example, Hello World, in Python (below). Here we're simply printing to screen. If we put that single line into a blank file (called, say, HelloWorld.py]) and then run that in the command line by typing 'python HelloWorld.py' the script should run with no problems. This also shows off the first Python function, print, which can be used to print strings or numbers."

    "There are, however, a few lines that you will usually see in a Python script. The first line often starts with `\"#!\"` and is called the \"shebang\". For a Python script (a `.py` file), an example of the shebang line would be `\"#!/usr/bin/env python\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Within Python, any line that starts with `\"#\"` is a comment, and won't be executed when running the script. The shebang, though, is there for the shell. If you run the script by calling python explicitly, then the script will be executed in Python. If, however, you want to make the script an executable (which can be run just by typing `\"./HelloWorld.py\"`) then the shell won't know what language the script should be run in. This is the information included in the shebang line. You don't need it, in general, but it's a good habit to have in case you ever decide to run a script as an executable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common thing at the starts of scripts is several lines that start with `'import'`. These lines allow you to allow import individual functions or entire modules (files that contain multiple functions). These can be those you write yourself, or things like numpy, matplotlib, etc.\n",

That means that variable types are entirely defined by what the variable is stored.\n",

However, we can put a string in there instead with no problems. However, we can't treat it as a number anymore and add to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try \"Un-Commenting\" the 5th line (print x+10) by removing the # to the front of that line, and we'll see that Python will still add *strings* to it."
