    "# What is [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, is a source-code editor made by Microsoft with the Electron Framework, for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. VSCode is a free, open source software that is designed to make programming easier! \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: I'm very old-school and use vim primarily, however a lot of modern astronomers use VScode! With that said, I'm fairly new to VScode myself!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, please visit the [__download page__](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) to begin the download of the VSCode software. It should be a `.zip` file. Use your __Finder__ to click on this `.zip` file (it's likely in your __`Downloads`__ folder) and it will unzip an _Application_ called ___Visual Studios Code___.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, drag this _Application_ file into your ___Applications___ folder. Then click on it to start it up. You should see a Welcome Screen like this:\n",

    "To do so, first we need to install the Python extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pull up the \"__Command Palette__\" by typing `command + shift + P` or going to the toolbar at the top and selecting __View__ then then __Command Palette__. It should pull up a text box like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/vscode2.png\" width=\"60%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In the text box, enter `Extensions: Install Extensions`. It should then pull up a window like this:\n",

    "<img src=\"./images/vscode3.png\" width=\"60%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to want to install the `Python` extension. However, this Python will not be the same version of Python as our Anaconda installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda installs Python in a default directory located at:\n",

    "```\n",

    "/usr/bin/python3 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To make sure VSCode is using Anaconda, we now need to go to the toolbar at the top, select __Code__, then __Preferences__, then __Settings__. It should pull up a window that looks like this:\n",

    "<img src=\"./images/vscode4.png\" width=\"60%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, in the main window (under the __Settings__ tab), click on __>Extensions__, then scroll down to __Python__ and click on it. You should then see a window that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/vscode5.png\" width=\"60%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We then want to click on the blue text that says ___Edit in settings.json___:\n",

    "Now that we're properly configured, let's close our tabs for __Extensions__ and __Settings__ and then go to the toolbar at the top and select __File__, then __Open__. This will prompt us to select a folder to initialize our _Workspace_ from. Let's select __\"Notebook_03__\" from our copied CUNY Bridge Bootcamp folders on our Desktops.\n",

    "Once you do, you should see a new toolbar on the left has appeared, like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's type `command + s` to save this file and let's called `\"hello.py\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the `.py` file extension, you tell VS Code to interpret this file as a Python program, so that it evaluates the contents with the Python extension and the selected interpreter.\n",
    "\n",

    "Let's now, modify the contents of our hello.py file in the main window:\n",

    "This is super useful! Press `tab` to auto-complete commands!\n",
    "\n",
    "Auto-completions work for standard Python modules as well as other packages you've installed into the environment of the selected Python interpreter. It also provides completions for methods available on object types. For example, because the msg variable contains a `\"string\"`, VScode provides string methods when you type msg.:\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/vscode10.png\" width=\"60%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notice, I mispelled \"print\" and it is underlined with a yellow sqiggly line. This is super useful for catching typos!\n",

    "\n",
    "Next, on the left-most tool bar, there should be an icon that looks like a bug on a Play button. This is the __`Run & Debug`__ button.

    "\n",
    "A debug toolbar appears in a new window on the lower left called a __\"Call Stack\"__ and when hovering your cursor over the debug session, you'll see a new tool bar with the following commands from left to right: continue (`F5`), step over (`F10`), step into (`F11`), step out (`shift + F11`), restart (`command + shift + F5`), and stop (`shift+F5`):\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's build upon the previous example by using packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, packages are how you obtain any number of useful code libraries, typically from PyPI, that provide additional functionality to your program. For this example, you use the `numpy` package to generate a random number.\n",

    "In the main window where our `hello.py` script is located, let's add the lines:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we then remove our _breakpoint_ and then click __Debug Python File__ from the pull down menu on the Play button in the upper right tool bar, we'll see that our code fully compiles without error and generates a random dice roll:\n",
