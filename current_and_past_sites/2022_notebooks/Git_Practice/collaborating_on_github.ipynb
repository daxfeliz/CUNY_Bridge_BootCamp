    "# My First Pull Request Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you've caught a bug in open source code that you would like to correct. We'll walk through the steps to making a _pull request_ in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's a pull request? \n",
    "\n",
    "Some open source projects like [astropy](https://github.com/astropy/astropy) have >100 contributors located all around the world. How do you successfully manage the efforts of so many people? \n",
    "\n",
    "Contributors to the astropy repository _fork_, or make their own copy of, the astropy repository. They make changes on their fork, where no special permissions are needed to make changes. Then, they can offer those changes back to the _upstream_ repository, or the repository that they forked, in a _pull request_. The pull request is a means of offering your changes to the \"official\" version of the repository, where collaborators can review your changes and choose to _merge_ them, i.e. accept them into the upstream repository, or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "We will work on this [demo repository directory](https://github.com/daxfeliz/Git_Practice), which has a bunch of non-functioning functions written in it. Your task in this lesson will be to:\n",
    "1. Fork the demo repo, and clone your fork\n",
    "2. Create an _issue_ where you describe what work needs to be done\n",
    "3. Create a _feature branch_\n",
    "4. Implement one of the non-implemented functions in your feature branch\n",
    "5. Add, commit and push your update to github\n",
    "6. Create a pull request to the upstream repository\n",
    "7. Pull changes from upstream\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) Fork, clone the demo repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow this link to the [demo repository](https://github.com/daxfeliz/Git_Practice/), and click the **Fork** button in the upper-right corner of the webpage. This will create a copy of this repository that you have permission to edit as you please. When the repo has been successfully forked, you will be taken to a webpage that's labeled `<your git username>/Git_Practice` in the upper-left corner. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now from your forked repo, click the green \"Clone or download\" button. You'll now see a link that you can use to _clone_ the repository. Copy that link, which looks like: `git@github.com:<your username>/Git_Practice.git`.\n",
