So, we can look at the standard programming example, Hello World, in Python (below). Here we're simply printing to screen. If we put that single line into a blank file (called, say, HelloWorld.py]) and then run that in the command line by typing 'python HelloWorld.py' the script should run with no problems. This also shows off the first Python function, print, which can be used to print strings or numbers."

The first function, called __init__, is going to be run as soon as we create an object belonging to this class, and so that'll create two attributes to that object, value and square. The other function, powerraise, only gets called if we call it. Try adding some other subfunctions in there to try this out. They don't need to have anything new passed to them to be run."
