    "# Step 7: Oops! We messedededed up. Let's revert that change by undoing the Last Commit and Restore to the Previous State:\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "git reset --soft HEAD~1\n",
    "```\n",
    "__Explanation__:\n",
    "* Moves the current branch pointer (i.e., HEAD) to the previous commit (HEAD~1), undoing the last commit.\n",
    "* __Keeps the changes staged__: The changes made in the undone commit remain in the staging area (they’re ready to be committed again).\n",
    "* This is useful if you want to rewrite the last commit (e.g., correct the commit message) or make further changes before committing again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2:  Hard Reset\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git reset --hard HEAD~1\n",
    "```\n",
    "__Explanation__:\n",
    "* Moves the current branch pointer to the previous commit (HEAD~1), just like the soft reset.\n",
    "* __Discards all changes__: Any changes made in the undone commit are completely lost—they’re not staged, not committed, and not even present in your working directory.\n",
    "* This is a more destructive operation, typically used when you want to completely discard the last commit and any changes associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Once you've chosen your method of resetting (I recommend soft reset), then we force a push to revert to a previous state:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git push --force-with-lease\n",
    "```\n",
    "__Explanation__:\n",
    "* Forcefully pushes your changes to the remote repository, effectively rewriting history.\n",
    "* `--force-with-lease` is safer than `--force` because it checks if anyone else has pushed to the branch before allowing the force push. If someone has pushed, it stops the force push, preventing accidental overwrites of others' work."
