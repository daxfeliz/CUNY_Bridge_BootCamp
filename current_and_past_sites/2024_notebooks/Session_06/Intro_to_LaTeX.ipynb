    "# What is Overleaf?\n",
    "The aim of Overleaf is to make the process of writing, collaborating, and publishing scientific documents in LaTeX quicker and easier by oâ†µering a Rich Text what-you-see-is-what-you-get overlay, a browser-based editor that allows direct code editing, and templates for major journals (providing authors with the correct formatting for the paper and references). They also offer thesis and dissertation templates, which both CalTech and Stanford are using. Multiple writers can collaborate simultaneously on a document with automatic saving and advanced history and\n",
    "version control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overleaf is currently used by [600,000 authors at more than 3600 institutions in 180 countries](https://www.overleaf.com/blog/449-600-000-users-on-overleaf-make-over-2-billion-edits),\n",
    "including CalTech, Stanford, MIT, Harvard, and Brown. They have detailed training pages and\n",
    "an active live support system for troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# When to use Overleaf?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Support collaborative research teams who need to write together.\n",
    "* Support academic publishing with integrated publication submission to top engineering and science journals, including templates.\n",
    "* Streamline thesis and dissertation formatting and submission, a process that libraries often support. Purdue now uses Overleaf for [over 35% of STEM thesis submissions](https://www.overleaf.com/blog/447-case-study-purdue-university-graduate-school-improves-thesis-authoring-and-submission-processes).\n",

    "### If I have a free account and want to collaborate with more than one co-author, what should I do?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer: \n",
    "### Your research mentor will likely have their own subscription or a subscription through their institution. They can create a document for you and list you as an \"Editor\". That way, you can collaborate with at least 10+ co-authors for any manuscripts/thesis/dissertation you may write."
